menu must show in the right side after login: Lista de meus favoritos (twohearts35.png), Lista de meu anuncios (portfolio.png), Alterar meus dados (user photo or user.png) and Encerrar sessao (logout)

Notes:

This is a scaffold. You’ll need to implement logic for categories, photo uploads, modals, and API calls.
For Froala, install react-froala-wysiwyg and required CSS.
For star ratings, use a React star rating library.
For tooltips, use <OverlayTrigger> and <Tooltip> from React Bootstrap.
Move navbar and footer to their own components if needed.


1. General Strategy
Break the page into logical React components (Header, Navbar, Modals, Tabs, Forms, Footer, etc).
Use React Bootstrap components for layout, navigation, forms, and modals.
Replace jQuery and imperative DOM manipulation with React state and event handlers.
For tooltips, tabs, and modals, use React Bootstrap’s built-in components.
For the Froala editor, use react-froala-wysiwyg.
For star ratings, use a React star rating component (e.g., react-star-ratings).
